ehset its <li> <a> </a> </li>
and then read the website I sent for the classes u need to apply
so for example <ul class="nav"> is one u need,
same with <li class="nav-item"> and <a class="nav-link">
also go back to pluralsight, go to bootstrap 5 fundsaments, and go to course 5 "expanding the site using boostrap components", theres a video called "demo using the nav and navbar components" that will help too
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/ heres the card info
